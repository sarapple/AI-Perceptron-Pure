# Perceptron Learning Algorithm

Given a csv with features and a corresponding label, generate a new line that defines the decision boundary that the PLA has computed for the the given dataset.

Each iteration will print a comma separated list of w_1, w_2, and b until convergence to an output file output1.csv

# To Run
