# Perceptron Learning Algorithm

Given a csv with features and a corresponding label, generate a new line that defines the decision boundary that the PLA has computed for the the given dataset.

Each iteration will print a comma separated list of w_1, w_2, and b until convergence to an output file output1.csv

# To Run

python3 problem1.py input1.csv output1.csv

# Visualization

All incremental steps of the algorithm displaying the data and the decision boundary are shown in the `figures/` folder.
